# My food diary, making your food journalling easy

Customers want to take action to improve their diet. Research shows that keeping a diary of food intake for a week leads to better diets. It helps users gain awareness of what theyâ€™re putting in their body, and also allows trained nutritionists to give targeted advice.

Demo

Since the app is still in the development process, some features are not available on mobile devices.

## Setup


1. Login your GitHub account in your VSCode | command prompt.
2. After logging in, command `git clone https://github.com/Kaia15/openai-food-app` to download my repo.
3. Open VSCode, command `npm install` to install all needed packages.

## Change Database (optional)

### Image Storage: 
Since I use my own Firebase and store the images, you can create your own Firebase storage to store your own images. After signing up and following Firebase guide, you can change your Firebase config in `src/utils/firebase.tsx`.

### Object storage:
You can add your backend server and connect with your own database. In this app, because of time limitation, I only store the objects in LocalStorage.
