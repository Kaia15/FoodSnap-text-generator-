        "description": " Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish that typically consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, with toppings. This particular bowl includes: - A piece of nori (dried seaweed), which is the large black item on top. - Slices of chashu, which is the rolled and braised pork belly or loin giving a pink hue. - Chopped green onions/scallions in the middle. - Two halves of a soft-boiled egg that show a runny yolk. - It looks like there is spinach or a similar leafy green in the soup as well. - The broth appears to be a cloudy type, which could mean it is a tonkotsu broth made from boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen over high heat for many hours. There also seems to be a side salad in the background with fresh vegetables, possibly containing lettuce and tomato.",
